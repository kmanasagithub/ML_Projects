# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts whether a loan application will be **approved or rejected** based on applicant financial and personal information.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Financial institutions receive thousands of loan applications daily. Manual evaluation is time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. This project builds a classification model that automates loan approval decisions by learning patterns from historical applicant data — helping lenders make faster, data-driven, and fair credit decisions.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains information about loan applicants including: 

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| `Gender` | Male / Female |
| `Married` | Marital status |
| `Dependents` | Number of dependents |
| `Education` | Graduate / Not Graduate |
| `Self_Employed` | Self-employed or not |
| `ApplicantIncome` | Monthly income of the applicant |
| `CoapplicantIncome` | Monthly income of the co-applicant |
| `LoanAmount` | Loan amount (in thousands) |
| `Loan_Amount_Term` | Term of the loan (in months) |
| `Credit_History` | Credit history meets guidelines (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |
| `Property_Area` | Urban / Semi-Urban / Rural |
| `Loan_Status` | **Target** — Y (Approved) / N (Rejected) |

## 🔍 Workflow

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution of loan approvals across categories
- Correlation between income, loan amount, and approval status
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Imputation of missing values (median for numerical, mode for categorical)
- Label encoding for categorical features
- Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
- Train-test split

### 3. Model Building
Multiple classification models were trained and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression

### 4. Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC Curve

### 💡 Key Insights
- Credit History is the strongest predictor of loan approval.
- Applicants with higher combined income have a significantly better approval rate.
- Semi-urban property area applicants show slightly higher approval rates.
- Handling class imbalance improved model recall for rejected loans.
